    "\n",
    "[Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org) is an open-source platform for media analysis. It is a collaborative academic project supported by various non-profit foundations since 2011. It is now led by a consortium of [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://publicinfrastructure.org), [Northeastern University](http://dataculture.northeastern.edu), the [Media Ecosystems Analysis Group](https://www.mediaecosystems.org). You can use our various online tools to investigate news coverage about your topic of interest, and all the same information is available via a rich API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of notebooks is a brief introduction to the API. It covers many of the most common operations we see researchers performing. The API is fully featured, so much so that [all our web-based tools](https://search.mediacloud.org/) are built on top of it.\n",

    "You need to instantiate a client with your **private** API key. This key is linked to your account, and has a quota attached to it so you don't blow up our servers. If you use up your quota then you will see errors returned in your API calls. It is reset automatically every week. Email us if you need to increase your quota.\n",

    "To obtain your api key, you can:\n",
    "1. [login to any of our tools](https://search.mediacloud.org/sign-in)\n",
