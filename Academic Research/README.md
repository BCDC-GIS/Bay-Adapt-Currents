# Research on Sea Level Rise in the Bay Area
## Summary
Using Open Alex, BCDC staff searched for Articles on "Sea Level Rise" and " San Francisco Bay." Open Alex assigns each article a relevancy score for the topic and works are generated from more to less relevant. BCDC staff performed an API pull of the top 1,000 articles based on the search criteria (Open Alex limits you to 10 API pulls of 100 articles each).  

The data was loaded into Excel. Columns with information on "ID," "title," "relevance score," publication year," "publication date," "language," "primary location," "type," "type crossref," "open access," "authorship," "cited by count," and "referenced works count" were expanded. The "authorship" column was further expanded to reveal information about the author, institution, and source country. Because many academic articles have more than one author or source institution, many articles are listed multiple times in the source data sheet. However, only the first occurrence of a title is included in the graph to avoid double counting of articles.
