# Assessment of Sea Level Rise Policies and Programs in General Plans
Sea level rise has the ability to broadly affect our near-shore communities. As increases in mean sea level (MSL) will directly push shorelines further inland, it will raise the risk for inundation during storm surges, erosion of critical infrastructure and natural shoreline components, and other threats to coastal development. City- and county-level policies aimed at tackling sea level rise vary across the Bay, as do the primary threats addressed in such policies due to political and geographic differences between localities. To create the Bay Conservation and Development Commission’s inventory of local policies targeting sea level rise, we first searched general plans and other relevant documents for the following keywords:
  - Sea Level Rise
  - Inundation
  - Flood
  - SLR
  - sea level
  - adapt* (to capture adapt, adaptation, adapting to)
  - rising (to capture rising sea, rising tide)
  - vulnerab* (to capture vulnerable, vulnerability)
  - resilien* (to capture resilience, resilient)
  - Retreat
  - sea wall
  - Seawall
  - Levee
  - beach restoration
  - wetland restoration
  - marsh restoration
  - tide gate
  - tidal gate
  - Groundwater
  - Storm surge

In determining which policies to add to the regional inventory, each individual policy containing one or more keywords was assessed for its relevancy to sea level rise and its associated impacts on coastal communities. If sea level rise was not explicitly mentioned in the policy, the policy would be further reviewed for the inclusion of themes such as coastal/flood resilience, wetland restoration, flood control efforts in coastal watersheds, retreat/setback from areas either currently or potentially prone to flooding, or more generally, climate adaptation and related hazard mitigation. We strived to make these judgements of relevancy as consistent as possible, which was ensured by a thorough review of each policy and the context in which it appeared in its associated plan.

With some exceptions, general plans include up to three types of actionable measures: goals, policies, and (implementation) programs/actions. At the highest level, goals establish a broad theme for a set of policies and programs. These can be useful when trying to understand the specific context within which a policy has been made. An example goal from the Vallejo General Plan is “Hazard Protection: Protect life and property from natural and man-made hazards.” While goals are important to establishing the major topics of a general plan we only tracked policies related to sea level rise on a policy and programmatic level.
In the creation of this inventory, while some policies (particularly those related to flood adaptation) may seem to be a bit too broad to be concretely linked to SLR adaptation, many of the policies we determined to be relevant to the inventory were considered so based on their connection to climate adaptation goals. Policies occupy some sort of middle ground, more clearly stating the processes that will inform decision-making in pursuit of a goal. One of the policies corresponding to the goal listed above reads as follows:

_**Sea Level Rise. Plan for sea level rise and participate in regional adaptation efforts for areas of Vallejo at risk from sea level rise.**_

Formal policies are a component of every general plan and can offer insight into the way in which a city or county intends to pursue a goal without delving too much into site-level specifics, allowing for a relatively consistent basis of comparison between jurisdictions. Programs, sometimes referred to as implement(-ing/-ation) actions, programs, or measures, propose more explicit initiatives to carry out a policy or set of policies. A program connected to the policy above reads: 

_**For City underground utilities, use materials that are more resistant to corrosion from saltwater intrusion.**_

At times, a program might be linked directly to an individual policy stated earlier in the document, which is noted in the “Relevant Programs/Implementation Actions” column of the Regional SLR policy inventory. 

Following a review of policies initially included in the inventory, BCDC Adapting to Rising Tides – Data & Science Unit staff filtered out any policies that were not ultimately considered within the scope of our study, and ensured that our considerations of each policy were consistent across the General Plans of the 55 cities/towns and 9 counties we eventually reviewed. BCDC Staff then characterized each policy as fitting into one or more of the following categories, if any were applicable:
  - **Affordable housing** includes houseboats, residential arks, mobile homes etc.
  - **Beaches or dunes**
  - **Building codes or standards** includes zoning, construction standards, design standards, ordinances
  - **Community engagement** for example forming a committee to discuss shoreline protection; this goes beyond educational outreach or awareness building
  - **Contamination or hazardous materials**
  - **Coordination** between adjoining properties or jurisdictions; with utilities; or regional/state/federal entities or their guidelines
  - **Cultural or historic preservation**
  - **Development** anything to do with building, developing, redeveloping
  - **Economy or jobs** (terms economy*, job, industr*, commercial, employ)
  - **Education or outreach**
  - **Emergency preparedness**
  - **Erosion**
  - **Expenditures** if capital improvements, investment, or budget/funding for a certain project or task are mentioned
  - **Flood or stormwater** assigned to any policy/program that mentions the word “flood,” excluding those that focus only on dam-related flooding
  - **Funding** usually language like “identify funding” or “seek funding”
  - **Groundwater** policies/programs that specifically mention groundwater
  - **Planning** task assigned to any policy/program that specifies or implies a climate adaptation planning task
  - **Habitat or environmental quality** ecosystem services, environmental quality, natural resources
  - **Infrastructur**e anything to do with services or resources used by the community (searched on “critical” and “infrastructure” and “trail” and “transport”). Does not necessarily get a 1 when Expenditures gets a 1…but can have one if the expenditures are related to improvement in service or resources
  - **Managed retreat**
  - **Mapping** usually developing maps, or applying existing maps during planning
  - **Levees and Seawalls** assigned to any policy/program mentioning levee, seawall, or other form of protection; “defense”
  - **Nature Based Solutions** assigned to any policy/program that mentions nature based solutions or green infrastructure
  - **Open space or recreation**
  - **Public health**
  - **Research or monitoring** anything related to keeping up with climate science, or any other research or monitoring effort specified for a particular project or planning task (but not review of development proposals)
  - **Sea Level Rise policies/programs** that specifically mention sea level rise, rising seas etc.
  - **Training**
  - **Mobility** anything related to mobility from roads to bike paths, ports, streets, trails, rail, ports, marinas, ferries, airport
  - **Utilities** Sewer, electricity, or water (waste, wastewater, water suppl*, utilit*, service)
  - **Vulnerable populations** language focusing on vulnerable people and/or disproportionate impacts; environmental justice; equity; disadvantage*
  - **Water quality** includes policies/programs with a focus on vessel pollution
  - **Wetlands** includes marsh
    
These categories were based on principles set forth in the One Bay Vision, a foundational document for the [Regional Shoreline Adaptation Plan](https://www.bcdc.ca.gov/regional-shoreline-adaptation-plan-bpa-1-24/), which was published in December 2025. In the context of the Bay Adapt Curretns, these categories should assist BCDC staff, policymakers, frontline communities, and concerned residents alike understand where there are gaps in sea level rise adaptation strategies across the Bay Area, as communicated through General Plan documents.
