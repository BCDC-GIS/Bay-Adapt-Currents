# Funding for Adaptation
## Data Summary
Data for this metric was gathered from the [Plan Bay Area 2050+ Needs and Revenue Forecast](https://planbayarea.org/sites/default/files/meetings/attachments/6112/10av_24_1150_Attachment_D_Final_Environment_Needs_and_Revenue.pdf), an update to the existing revenues spreadsheet that was created for the [2023 Sea Level Rise Adaptation Funding & Investment Framework](https://mtc.ca.gov/planning/resilience/sea-level-rise-adaptation-funding-investment-framework). 

Additional data on the funding of adaptation projects came form the Shoreline Adaptation Project Map (SAPMap). SAPMap was created in 2021 to track adaptation project progress in the Bay. BCDC's Community Vulnerability Mapping was also used in conjunction with the SAPMap Data. 

## Methodology
BCDC Staff performed light data validation steps on the Plan Bay Area Data.

To calculate the amount of project funding going toward communities with high social or contamination vulnerability, BCDC staff first overlaid the SAPMap locations with the Community Vulnerability Mapping dataset in GIS. Based on project center points, projects were labeled as being in "social," "social and contamination," or "contamination" vulnerability areas. Next, we divided the total funding sum of habitat projects by the amount of funding in social vulnerability areas. This included areas labeled as both "social" and "social and contamination." We then repeated this step for contamination vulnerability. Because an area can be considered as having a high social and contamination vulnerability, it is important to note there is overlap in the percentages.
