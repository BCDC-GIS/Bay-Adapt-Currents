# Dredged Sediment used for Shoreline Adaptation
## Data Summary
Data for this metric was gathered from the [Dredging Material Management Office (DMMO)](https://www.spn.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dredging-Work-Permits/Dredged-Material-Management-Office-DMMO/Annual-Reports/) Annual Data Tables kept in BCDC staff records from 2000-2007 and the DMMO Annual Reports from 2008-2024. The DMMO is a joint effort by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission.  

## Methodology
- Gathered dredging season tables from sediment team (2000-2007)
  - Recorded project name, and cubic yards of sediment for each project labeled beneficial reuse/upland
  - Met with BCDC sediment team to remove projects from data set that were upland or were beneficial reuse for agriculture rather than wetland restoration.  

- Reviewed Annual Reports (2007-2023)
  - Added Beneficial Reuse Projects to spreadsheet with annual cubic yards for each project
  - Highlighted projects that were unclear if they were beneficial reuse for wetland restoration
