# Regional Environmental Health Metrics
## Data Summary
BCDC Staff performed snowball sampling of adaptation professionals to ensure that we were capturing all relevant datasets. We collected information on the program/project, when it started, the data coverage area, and provided a link to the platform. Some of the metrics and monitoring projects are from static documents and represent a specific moment in time, while others are updated more frequently.

Data for this metric was gathered from each of the metrics and monitoring projects. These datasets are maintained by the [San Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI)](https://www.sfei.org/),  [The California Natural Resources Agency](https://resources.ca.gov/), [The Ocean and Coastal Policy Center at UCSB](https://ocpc.msi.ucsb.edu/),  [The Delta Stewardship Council](https://deltacouncil.ca.gov/), [San Francisco Estuary Partnership (SFEP)](https://www.sfestuary.org/), [Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)](https://mtc.ca.gov/), [San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority (SFBRA)](https://www.sfbayrestore.org/), and [the Wetlands Regional Monitoring Program (WRMP)](https://www.wrmp.org/).
